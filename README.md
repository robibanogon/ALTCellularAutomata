## Creating the artwork

Using Cellular Automata (CA) and NetLogo, we made 6 small artworks, which can be found in the folder `artworks`, and combined it into a single landscape art, `final_artwork.png`. The CA model used for each small artwork is listed below:

- **grass** - CA Stochastic
  - III - 86.5%
  - IOI - 100.0%
  - OII - 95.5%
  - OOI - 14.5%
  - IIO - 86.5%
  - IOO - 5.5%
  - OIO - 6.5%
  - OOO - 0.0%
- **mountains** - CA 1D Elementary (Rule 250)
- **plains** - Using 2 alternating CA 1D Elementary (Rule 66 and 67)
  - The plains were created by switching between two rules while running it on NetLogo.
- **river** - CA 1D Elementary (Rule 113)
- **snow** - CA Stochastic
  - III - 1.0%
  - IOI - 1.0%
  - OII - 1.0%
  - OOI - 1.0%
  - IIO - 1.0%
  - IOO - 1.0%
  - OIO - 1.0%
  - OOO - 1.0%
- **lightning** - CA Stochastic
  - III - 0.0%
  - IOI - 88.0%
  - OII - 68.0%
  - OOI - 51.0%
  - IIO - 50.0%
  - IOO - 25.5%
  - OIO - 50.0%
  - OOO - 0.0%

We found it difficult to come up with a single artwork using only one rule, so we explored other rules as well as other models to create each element that would make up the final artwork. We ended up focusing on creating elements that can be found in nature.

The 6 individual elements were combined in Figma; some were overlaid on other elements, and the background of the overlaying elements were removed, such as the grass and the snow, to be able to see the elements behind them. Overall, we had fun exploring and experimenting the different rules and configurations of the CA models in NetLogo.
